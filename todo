x Get simulation working
x Make PRS scripts
x Use PRSice R to get best PRS scores
x load PRS into R
    x "all_score"
    x choose 3rd column
x Incorporate endo-PRS's into PRS
x Do PRS's do well if knowing the risk group
    - yes
x Can ppmx automatically detect the risk group?
    - Yes, by f1 stat
x write R part
    - make cli
x write python part 
    x make cli
x write bash part
x Run production level simulation on local comp
- run full scale simulation on MSI
x Explore different statistic to compare labeling?
x Remove ethnicities
x Add confounding before PRS
    x- BY VARYING FROM 0.25/0.75, 0.90/0.1, etc, 0.5/0.5, 0.4/0.6 for independence
x add additional covariates that are indpeendent and don't contirbute to clusters
    x this is like adding noise
    - Also, test leveL of noise
