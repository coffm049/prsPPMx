x Get simulation working
x Make PRS scripts
x Use PRSice R to get best PRS scores
x load PRS into R
    x "all_score"
    x choose 3rd column
x Incorporate endo-PRS's into PRS
x Do PRS's do well if knowing the risk group
    x yes
x Can ppmx automatically detect the risk group?
    x Yes, by f1 stat
x write R part
    x make cli
x write python part 
    x make cli
x write bash part
x Run production level simulation on local comp
x run full scale simulation on MSI
x Explore different statistic to compare labeling?
x Remove ethnicities
x Add confounding before PRS
    x BY VARYING FROM 0.25/0.75, 0.90/0.1, etc, 0.5/0.5, 0.4/0.6 for independence
x add additional covariates that are indpeendent and don't contirbute to clusters
    x this is like adding noise
    - Also, test leveL of noise

- Make a nonlinearirty in the outcome based on the endo phneotyps
- simulate the endophentypes with the risk groups
- different PRS slope for the gorup
    
- simualte an interaction between the risk group and the SNP effects for the endophenotypes
